# 5<sup>th</sup> Feb, 2024: Google Smartphone Decimeter Challenge

**We are reading the getting started with RTKLib Notebook by Tim Everett**

1. Tim does not use the Integer ambiguity because:

    *"...Typically, PPK solutions also use integer ambiguity resolution to further increase accuracy, but in this case, I am using only the float solutions, since the quality of the smartphone observations makes ambiguity resolution extremely challenging..."*
    **Maybe we can work on using the Integer!!**

**Tarig's Notes**

*Evaluation Procedure:

- N experiments per phone
- 50th and 95th percentile error for each experiment (e.g., Ph1-expt1, ph1-expt2, etc.)
- Average 50th and 95th percentiles for each phone over all experiments
- Average 50th and 95th percentile for all phones.
